## Main features

- **Advanced encryption**: Files are encrypted using symmetric cryptography algorithms before being fragmented and stored.

- **Fragmentation and redundancy**: Files are split into multiple fragments distributed across storage nodes, with redundancy for fault tolerance.

- **Infrastructure as code**: Infrastructure is deployed and managed using Terraform and Ansible, enabling reproducible and scalable configuration.

- **Intuitive web interface**: Frontend developed with Angular that allows users to easily upload, download and manage their files.

- **Automated deployment**: Use of Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and management of services.
